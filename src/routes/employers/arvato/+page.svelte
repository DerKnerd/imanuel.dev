	<h2 class="iuc-employer__heading-two">What did I do at Arvato?</h2>
	<p class="iuc-employer__text">
		In October 2013 I started working at Netrada Europe GmbH as a junior software engineer. During
		spring 2014 Netrada Europe GmbH was taken over by Arvato Bertelsmann and subsequently split into
		Arvato Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH and Arvato&nbsp;Betriebsgesellschaft&nbsp;mbH, separating
		administration and fulfillment.
	</p>
	<p class="iuc-employer__text">
		During my time at Arvato, I have gained a lot of experience in logistics and warehouse
		management software. Together with my colleagues I developed the order management system that
		was used by Arvato's customers. In the process of further development, I learned a lot about
		working with legacy systems and was able to significantly improve my skills in understanding
		foreign code.
