    <h2 class="iuc-employer__heading-two">What did I do at Computacenter?</h2>
    <p class="iuc-employer__text">
        In January 2015 I started to work at Computacenter&nbsp;AG&nbsp;&&nbsp;Co.&nbsp;oHG as a technology associate.
        At Computacenter I had my first contacts in the field of consulting. My first assignment was at IT.Niedersachsen
        to develop a new ordering system for internal hardware and software. This system was my first contact with a
        full SPA framework. Besides the ordering system, I developed a system for legally compliant storage and
        archiving of official documents.
    </p>
    <p class="iuc-employer__text">
        After the main requirements were implemented development slowed down. Therefore I was assigned a new project.
        This project was about a system for managing HP Service Manager incidents. Within a short turnaround time a
        colleague and I implemented this system and a new challenge was needed.
    </p>
    <p class="iuc-employer__text">
        My last project at Computacenter was an internal system for managing hardware rollouts for customers. This
        system was developed based on ASP.net&nbsp;MVC and a modern JavaScript frontend. I spent most of my time in the
        frontend project and discovered my love for design.
