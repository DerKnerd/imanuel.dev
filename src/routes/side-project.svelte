            The <i>Jinya Gallery CMS</i> is a content management system for artists in the fields of video, print, and
            digital art. Jinya offers an easy way to arrange and display the artworks. This enables a drag and drop
            based
            solution which we have named <i>Gallery Designer</i>.

            My good friend and artist <a class="iuc-side-project__link" href="https://jenny-jinya.com"
                                         target="_blank">Jenny-Jinya</a> approached me,
            because she wanted a new website. She asked me to check what’s possible. She explicitly wanted a solution
            that
            is specially adapted to the presentation of artwork. Since I had broad knowledge of various programming
            languages, I informed myself directly what was possible. In doing so, I looked at the requirements from
            different angles. On the one hand, the solution should be very performant to reduce unnecessary waiting
            times
            on the end user side. On the other hand, an administration as simple as possible and going live soon was
            desired. Since the application should be hosted on a shared hoster, it was only possible to use PHP. In the
            backend, which is called <i>Designer</i>, we were relatively free in the design, but decided to use a simple
            two-part design.
        </p>
        <p class="iuc-side-project__paragraph">
            The designer was divided into two areas, one for data maintenance and another for the placement of artworks
            in
            the galleries. At that time only images were implemented, and videos were not yet planned. However, the
            implementation of the CMS was delayed, because I was more involved in my job and therefore didn't have
            leisure
            time to take care of the CMS intensively. However, after a while I was able to improve my work—life balance
            and could spend more time with the development of the CMS. On February 10, 2018, after four months of
            development, the <i>Jinya Gallery CMS</i> was released as version 1.0.
        </p>
        <p class="iuc-side-project__paragraph">
            A lot has happened since that day.
        </p>
        <p class="iuc-side-project__paragraph">
            With version 2.0, which was released on May 18, 2018, there were some major changes. The original concept —
            the administration of the CMS in two different areas — has turned out to be extremely unintuitive and
            therefore the designer was redeveloped from scratch. The basic features of this designer are still present
            in
            the current <i>Jinya</i> version. The backend has not only changed visually, there were also several
            technical
            innovations. First, the classic MVC architecture of the application was scrapped and replaced by a simple
            RESTful API. This RESTful API enabled a much more flexible implementation of the designer and offers the
            possibility of opening up new end devices; previously, only desktop browsers were supported.
        </p>
        <p class="iuc-side-project__paragraph">
            The new designer version 2.0 was designed based on modern web technologies like Vue.js 2.5. The interface is
            a
            design developed from scratch, which tries to pack as many features as possible into a simple interface.
            With
            version 6.0 a static cache for the HTML files was implemented. This change has resulted in a significant
            performance increase for end users and reduced loading times to a few milliseconds.
        </p>
        <p class="iuc-side-project__paragraph">
            The last major change came with version 11.0, in the form of new media handling. Before version 10.0, images
            and videos were managed separately, and it was impossible to mix these types of art. This was replaced by
            the
            Media Manager. This change enables an artist to present their different works of art in the same way they
            are
            used to from platforms like Bēhance.

            The current version of the <i>Jinya Gallery CMS</i> is based on the PHP framework slim version 4.7. The
            designer was written in Svelte with ECMAScript 6. Since version 7.0.0 there are prepared Docker containers,
            which currently run <a class="iuc-side-project__link"
