# imanuel.dev

imanuel.dev is my personal developer portfolio. The goal was to provide a good looking, easy to use website for
requiters to check my skills before they talk with me.

## Technology

The portfolio is based on Svelte and SvelteKit. The code is held in modern EcmaScript and can also be seen as a project
to show my design skills.

## License

Like everything else I create the portfolio is licensed under the MIT license. If you want to use the design feel free,
but please change at least colors.
